don't mind the horrible code and lag, because i cba to optimise this shitty program, BUT FEEL FREE TO OPTIMISE FOR ME :)
i made this as a joke using friends' faces and making their attacks relate to their personality. One is obsessed with japanese.
the other is obsessed with arguing and always being right. It became a "proper" game as i saw some potential.
Feel free to take this and do what you want with it, (please don't use the images of friends) thanks, bye :)
if you are going to make a commit, please create a new branch for yourself. Ta, love!
